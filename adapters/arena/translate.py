"""Adapter for the organisers' arena (#8). docs/ENVIRONMENT.md has the protocol notes.

Their engine (Manchester-AI-Society/poker_bot_infrastructure, `player_sdk`) calls `PokerBot.act(game_state)`
and expects a `Response`. This module turns their GameState into ours (docs/API.md), runs any `Bot`, and turns
our `Action` back into a `Response`. Differences it handles:

* Cards: theirs "AS" (upper-case suit), ours "As".
* Amounts: their `raise_to` / `bet` / `min_raise_to` / `max_raise_to` are totals for the current **street**;
  ours are totals for the **hand**. History: `call` records the chips added; `bet` and `raise_to` record the
  street total; the first two entries are `post_small_blind` / `post_big_blind`.
* No new-hand / hand-over callbacks: we detect a new hand ourselves, and synthesise the previous hand's
  `HandResult` from what we saw (opponent cards are never shown; when our last bet before the river got no
  further turn, the opponent folded, so we record that fold).
* Anything that goes wrong becomes a safe move (check, else fold), never an exception.

No imports from `player_sdk` here: the `Response` class is passed in, so this file is testable without it.
